The article starts by outlining the key definition of telehealth and how it is a rapidly evolving industry, however few articles exist that characterise its current status. The focus is then on the current trends in the area with a focus on three main areas as follows:

1.     The transformation of the application of telehealth from increasing access to healthcare to providing convenience and eventually reducing cost

2.     The expansion of telehealth from addressing acute conditions to also addressing episodic and chronic conditions
3.     The migration of telehealth from hospitals and satellite clinics to the home and mobile devices
