The article starts by outlining the key definition of telehealth and how it is a rapidly evolving industry, however few articles exist that characterise its current status. The focus is then on the current trends in the area with a focus on three main areas as follows:

1.     The transformation of the application of telehealth from increasing access to healthcare to providing convenience and eventually reducing cost

2.     The expansion of telehealth from addressing acute conditions to also addressing episodic and chronic conditions
3.     The migration of telehealth from hospitals and satellite clinics to the home and mobile devices

Summary of the article 

The paper starts with defining key terms and concepts in relation to social media and public health and then provides key examples of how it has been used. The article focuses on the utility of social media for public health, with an emphasis on its application for disease surveillance. While disease surveillance is the focal point of this paper, the discussions in this paper are useful more widely on the role and use of social media and the advantages, disadvantages and knowledge gaps to its use. 

Following the introductory section, the article then focuses on the defining public health, health data and the internet and discusses the importance of information and that it is at the core of public health. The important role of timeliness of data is also highlighted and then specific examples are provided, for example, the 2009 H1N1 event and Haiti Cholera outbreak where social media was used with promising results to  indicate disease outbreak trends quicker and with higher reliability compared with traditional methods of public health reporting. Other interesting examples are also provided focusing on the role of data mining.

The main section of the paper focuses on the benefits and challenges of using social media generally and then with a focus on disease surveillance with some specific examples. A range of benefits are discussed and the key challenges such as verification of data are highlighted as well as other challenges and mining social media data and the challenges associated with this. Issues such as the use of specific information including Global Positioning System information and consent to use this information are raised and issues of overfitting, particularly with reference to machine learning. There is then a discussion of ways to overcome these issues such as avoiding the use of data from official sources during the development of models, with an example related to the use of machine learning algorithm for vaccine coverage.

The focus is then on the use of social media platforms and their utility for disease surveillance and public health interventions and a number of examples are referenced including those for pharmaceutical shortages in Kenya, Uganda, Malawi and Zambia, humanitarian crises in Syria and during the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Examples of some of these platforms are provided among others, and lastly the role of mobile phone and the opportunities provided by them are discussed and the selected mobile applications or platforms for health including open-source tools, for example, OpenData kit and InSTEDD’s Geochat.  

The authors conclude that social media has a great role to play and we need to pay attention to its use in healthcare and public health. The benefits of social media are discussed and the important need for validation to improve its future use.
